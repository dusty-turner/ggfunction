  na.rm = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level
of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{Ignored by \code{stat_function()}, do not use.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer. When using
a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat} argument can be used
to override the default coupling between geoms and stats. The \code{stat} argument
accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This can be used in
various ways, including to prevent overplotting and improving the display.
The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example, to
use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{ggplot2::layer()}}.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If
\code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? \code{NA}, the default,
includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE}
always includes. It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the
aesthetics to display. To include legend keys for all levels, even when no
data exists, use \code{TRUE}.  If \code{NA}, all levels are shown in legend, but
unobserved levels are omitted.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with
them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and
aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default plot
specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:annotation_borders]{annotation_borders()}}.}

\item{fun}{A function to compute the quantile function (e.g. \link{qnorm}). The function must
accept a numeric vector of probabilities (values in \verb{[0,1]}) as its first argument.
Exactly one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun}, or \code{pdf_fun} must be provided.}

\item{cdf_fun}{A CDF function (e.g. \link{pnorm}). The quantile function is derived
numerically via root-finding. Exactly one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun}, or \code{pdf_fun}
must be provided.}

\item{pdf_fun}{A PDF function (e.g. \link{dnorm}). The CDF is first derived by
numerical integration, then the quantile function by root-finding. Exactly
one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun}, or \code{pdf_fun} must be provided.}

\item{n}{Number of probability points at which to evaluate \code{fun}. Defaults to 101.
Points are placed at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_nodes}{Chebyshev nodes}
of the first kind on $(0, 1)$, which cluster
near 0 and 1 where quantile functions are typically most curved, and never include
the exact endpoints (avoiding \eqn{\pm\infty} for unbounded distributions).}

\item{args}{A named list of additional arguments to pass to \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun},
or \code{pdf_fun}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 layer.
}
\description{
\code{geom_qf()} creates a ggplot2 layer that plots a quantile function (inverse CDF)
as a line. It computes quantile values for a sequence of probabilities (from 0 to 1)
and connects them with a line.
}
\details{
Supply exactly one of \code{fun} (a quantile function), \code{cdf_fun} (a CDF), or
\code{pdf_fun} (a PDF). When \code{cdf_fun} is supplied, the quantile function is
derived by numerical root-finding. When \code{pdf_fun} is supplied, the CDF is
first derived by numerical integration and then inverted.

  ggplot() +
    geom_qf(fun = qnorm, args = list(mean = 3, sd = 2))

  ggplot() +
    geom_qf(fun = qbeta, args = list(shape1 = 3, shape2 = 4))
