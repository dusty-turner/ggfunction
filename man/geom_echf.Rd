\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level
of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three options:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} (default): the data is inherited from the plot data as specified
in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.
\item A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot data. All objects
will be fortified to produce a data frame. See \code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which
variables will be created.
\item A \code{function} will be called with a single argument, the plot data. The return
value must be a \code{data.frame}, and will be used as the layer data. A
\code{function} can be created from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).
}}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer. When using
a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat} argument can be used
to override the default coupling between geoms and stats. The \code{stat} argument
accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This can be used in
various ways, including to prevent overplotting and improving the display.
The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example, to
use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}'s \code{params} argument. These arguments
broadly fall into one of 4 categories below. Notably, further arguments to
the \code{position} argument, or aesthetics that are required can
\emph{not} be passed through \code{...}. Unknown arguments that are not part of the 4
categories below are ignored.
\itemize{
\item Static aesthetics that are not mapped to a scale, but are at a fixed
value and apply to the layer as a whole. For example, \code{colour = "red"} or
\code{linewidth = 3}. The geom's documentation has an \strong{Aesthetics} section
that lists the available options. The 'required' aesthetics cannot be
passed on to the \code{params}. Please note that while passing unmapped
aesthetics as vectors is technically possible, the order and required
length is not guaranteed to be parallel to the input data.
\item When constructing a layer using
a \verb{stat_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on parameters
to the \code{geom} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{stat_density(geom = "area", outline.type = "both")}. The geom's
documentation lists which parameters it can accept.
\item Inversely, when constructing a layer using a
\verb{geom_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on parameters
to the \code{stat} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{geom_area(stat = "density", adjust = 0.5)}. The stat's documentation lists
which parameters it can accept.
\item The \code{key_glyph} argument of \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}} may also be passed on through
\code{...}. This can be one of the functions described as
\link[ggplot2:draw_key]{key glyphs}, to change the display of the layer in the legend.
}}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{TRUE}, silently remove missing values. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{show.legend}{Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? \code{NA}, the default,
includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE}
always includes. It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the
aesthetics to display. To include legend keys for all levels, even when no
data exists, use \code{TRUE}.  If \code{NA}, all levels are shown in legend, but
unobserved levels are omitted.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with
them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and
aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default plot
specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:annotation_borders]{annotation_borders()}}.}

\item{open_fill}{Fill color for the open (hollow) endpoint circles. Defaults
to \code{NULL}, which uses the active theme's panel background color.}

\item{vert_type}{Line type for the vertical jump segments. Defaults to
\code{"dashed"}.}

\item{show_points}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, suppresses all endpoint circles.
If \code{NULL} (the default), circles are shown when there are 50 or fewer
points and hidden otherwise.}

\item{show_vert}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, suppresses the vertical jump segments.
If \code{NULL} (the default), segments are shown when there are 50 or fewer
points and hidden otherwise.}

\item{conf_int}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default), draws a simultaneous KS
confidence band around the ECDF.}

\item{level}{Confidence level for the band. Defaults to \code{0.95}.}

\item{conf_alpha}{Alpha (transparency) of the confidence ribbon. Defaults
to \code{0.4}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 layer, or a list of two layers when \code{conf_int = TRUE}.
}
\description{
\code{geom_echf()} computes the empirical cumulative hazard function of a sample
and renders it as a right-continuous step function. The cumulative hazard is
obtained by transforming the empirical CDF:
\eqn{\hat{H}_n(x) = -\log(1 - \hat{F}_n(x))}. An optional simultaneous
confidence band (defaulting to 95\%) is drawn using a monotone transformation
of the DKW inequality.
}
\details{
The final observation, where \eqn{\hat{F}_n(x) = 1} and
\eqn{\hat{H}_n(x) = \infty}, is dropped so the step function extends to the
right panel edge at the last finite value.

The simultaneous confidence band transforms the DKW bounds on the CDF to the
cumulative hazard scale. The half-width on the CDF scale is
\eqn{\varepsilon = \sqrt{\log(2/\alpha) / (2n)}}, where
\eqn{\alpha = 1 - \texttt{level}}. The CDF bounds
\eqn{[\hat{F}_n(x) - \varepsilon,\, \hat{F}_n(x) + \varepsilon]} are
clipped to \eqn{[0, 1 - 1/(2n)]} and transformed via
\eqn{H = -\log(1 - F)} to give the band on the cumulative hazard scale.
This caps the displayed upper band at \eqn{\log(2n)}, since the ECDF has
resolution \eqn{1/n} and CDF values closer to 1 than \eqn{1/(2n)} are
below the estimator's resolution. When clipping occurs, an informational
message is emitted.
