\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{Ignored by \code{stat_function()}, do not use.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer.
When using a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat}
argument can be used to override the default coupling between geoms and
stats. The \code{stat} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This
can be used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and
improving the display. The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example,
to use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}'s \code{params} argument. These
arguments broadly fall into one of 4 categories below. Notably, further
arguments to the \code{position} argument, or aesthetics that are required
can \emph{not} be passed through \code{...}. Unknown arguments that are not part
of the 4 categories below are ignored.
\itemize{
\item Static aesthetics that are not mapped to a scale, but are at a fixed
value and apply to the layer as a whole. For example, \code{colour = "red"}
or \code{linewidth = 3}. The geom's documentation has an \strong{Aesthetics}
section that lists the available options. The 'required' aesthetics
cannot be passed on to the \code{params}. Please note that while passing
unmapped aesthetics as vectors is technically possible, the order and
required length is not guaranteed to be parallel to the input data.
\item When constructing a layer using
a \verb{stat_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on
parameters to the \code{geom} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{stat_density(geom = "area", outline.type = "both")}. The geom's
documentation lists which parameters it can accept.
\item Inversely, when constructing a layer using a
\verb{geom_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on parameters
to the \code{stat} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{geom_area(stat = "density", adjust = 0.5)}. The stat's documentation
lists which parameters it can accept.
\item The \code{key_glyph} argument of \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}} may also be passed on through
\code{...}. This can be one of the functions described as
\link[ggplot2:draw_key]{key glyphs}, to change the display of the layer in the legend.
}}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display. To include legend keys for all levels, even
when no data exists, use \code{TRUE}.  If \code{NA}, all levels are shown in legend,
but unobserved levels are omitted.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:annotation_borders]{annotation_borders()}}.}

\item{fun}{A function to compute the density (e.g. \link{dnorm}). The function must accept a
numeric vector as its first argument and return density values that integrate (approximately)
to 1.}

\item{xlim}{A numeric vector of length 2 giving the x-range over which to evaluate the PDF.}

\item{n}{(defaults to 101)Number of points at which to evaluate \code{fun}.}

\item{args}{A named list of additional arguments to pass to \code{fun}.}

\item{fill}{Fill color for the shaded area.}

\item{color}{Line color for the outline of the density curve.}

\item{linewidth}{Line width for the outline of the density curve.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha transparency for the shaded area.}

\item{p}{(Optional) A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the cumulative probability
threshold. The area will be shaded up until the point where the cumulative density reaches
this value.}

\item{lower.tail}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (the default) the shaded area extends from the left end
of the density up to the threshold. If \code{FALSE}, the shading extends from the threshold to the
right end.}

\item{p_lower}{(Optional) A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the lower cumulative
probability bound. Used with \code{p_upper} for two-sided shading.}

\item{p_upper}{(Optional) A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the upper cumulative
probability bound. Used with \code{p_lower} for two-sided shading.}

\item{shade_outside}{Logical; if \code{FALSE} (the default) shading is applied between \code{p_lower}
and \code{p_upper}. If \code{TRUE}, shading is applied to the tails outside that range.}

\value{
A ggplot2 layer.

\description{
\code{geom_pdf()} computes a probability density function and plots it as a filled area.
This function is similar to \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_function]{ggplot2::geom_function()}}, but it shades the area corresponding to
a given proportion of the total density.
