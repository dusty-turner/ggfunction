\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level
of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{Ignored by \code{stat_function()}, do not use.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer. When using
a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat} argument can be used
to override the default coupling between geoms and stats. The \code{stat} argument
accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This can be used in
various ways, including to prevent overplotting and improving the display.
The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example, to
use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}'s \code{params} argument. These arguments
broadly fall into one of 4 categories below. Notably, further arguments to
the \code{position} argument, or aesthetics that are required can
\emph{not} be passed through \code{...}. Unknown arguments that are not part of the 4
categories below are ignored.
\itemize{
\item Static aesthetics that are not mapped to a scale, but are at a fixed
value and apply to the layer as a whole. For example, \code{colour = "red"} or
\code{linewidth = 3}. The geom's documentation has an \strong{Aesthetics} section
that lists the available options. The 'required' aesthetics cannot be
passed on to the \code{params}. Please note that while passing unmapped
aesthetics as vectors is technically possible, the order and required
length is not guaranteed to be parallel to the input data.
\item When constructing a layer using
a \verb{stat_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on parameters
to the \code{geom} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{stat_density(geom = "area", outline.type = "both")}. The geom's
documentation lists which parameters it can accept.
\item Inversely, when constructing a layer using a
\verb{geom_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on parameters
to the \code{stat} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{geom_area(stat = "density", adjust = 0.5)}. The stat's documentation lists
which parameters it can accept.
\item The \code{key_glyph} argument of \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}} may also be passed on through
\code{...}. This can be one of the functions described as
\link[ggplot2:draw_key]{key glyphs}, to change the display of the layer in the legend.
}}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If
\code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? \code{NA}, the default,
includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE}
always includes. It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the
aesthetics to display. To include legend keys for all levels, even when no
data exists, use \code{TRUE}.  If \code{NA}, all levels are shown in legend, but
unobserved levels are omitted.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with
them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and
aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default plot
specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:annotation_borders]{annotation_borders()}}.}

\item{fun}{A function to compute the density (e.g. \link{dnorm}). The function must accept a
numeric vector as its first argument and return density values that integrate (approximately)
to 1. Exactly one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun}, \code{survival_fun}, \code{qf_fun}, or \code{hf_fun}
must be provided.}

\item{cdf_fun}{A CDF function (e.g. \link{pnorm}). When supplied, the PDF is derived
numerically via central finite differences. Exactly one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun},
\code{survival_fun}, \code{qf_fun}, or \code{hf_fun} must be provided.}

\item{survival_fun}{A survival function (e.g. \code{function(x) 1 - pnorm(x)}).
When supplied, the CDF is computed as \eqn{F(x) = 1 - S(x)} and then
differentiated to obtain the PDF. Exactly one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun},
\code{survival_fun}, \code{qf_fun}, or \code{hf_fun} must be provided.}

\item{qf_fun}{A quantile function (e.g. \link{qnorm}). When supplied, the CDF is
derived via interpolation and then differentiated to obtain the PDF. Exactly
one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun}, \code{survival_fun}, \code{qf_fun}, or \code{hf_fun} must be
provided.}

\item{hf_fun}{A hazard function (e.g. a Weibull hazard). When supplied, the
CDF is derived via numerical integration of the cumulative hazard and then
differentiated to obtain the PDF. Exactly one of \code{fun}, \code{cdf_fun},
\code{survival_fun}, \code{qf_fun}, or \code{hf_fun} must be provided.}

\item{xlim}{A numeric vector of length 2 giving the x-range over which to evaluate the PDF.}

\item{n}{(defaults to 101)Number of points at which to evaluate \code{fun}.}

\item{args}{A named list of additional arguments to pass to \code{fun}.}

\item{fill}{Fill color for the shaded area.}

\item{color}{Line color for the outline of the density curve.}

\item{linewidth}{Line width for the outline of the density curve.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha transparency for the shaded area.}

\item{p}{(Optional) A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the cumulative probability
threshold. The area will be shaded up until the point where the cumulative density reaches
this value.}

\item{lower.tail}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (the default) the shaded area extends from the left end
of the density up to the threshold. If \code{FALSE}, the shading extends from the threshold to the
right end.}

\item{p_lower}{(Optional) A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the lower cumulative
probability bound. Used with \code{p_upper} for two-sided shading.}

\item{p_upper}{(Optional) A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the upper cumulative
probability bound. Used with \code{p_lower} for two-sided shading.}

\item{shade_outside}{Logical; if \code{FALSE} (the default) shading is applied between \code{p_lower}
and \code{p_upper}. If \code{TRUE}, shading is applied to the tails outside that range.}

\item{shade_hdr}{(Optional) A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the coverage of the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credible_interval#Highest_density_interval}{highest density region}
(HDR) to shade. The HDR is the smallest region of the domain containing the specified
probability mass; for multimodal densities it may be disconnected, producing multiple
shaded intervals. Computed following the approach of \doi{10.32614/RJ-2023-048}: density
values are evaluated on the grid, normalized to sum to 1, sorted in descending order, and
cumulated until the target coverage is reached; the density at that threshold determines
which regions are shaded. Takes precedence over \code{p}, \code{p_lower}, and \code{p_upper} if specified.}

A ggplot2 layer.

\description{
\code{geom_pdf()} computes a probability density function and plots it as a filled area.
This function is similar to \code{\link[ggplot2:geom_function]{ggplot2::geom_function()}}, but it shades the area corresponding to
a given proportion of the total density.

f_bim <- function(x) 0.5 * dnorm(x, -2, 0.5) + 0.5 * dnorm(x, 2, 0.5)
