\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level
of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{Ignored by \code{stat_function()}, do not use.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer. When using
a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat} argument can be used
to override the default coupling between geoms and stats. The \code{stat} argument
accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This can be used in
various ways, including to prevent overplotting and improving the display.
The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example, to
use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{ggplot2::layer()}}.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If
\code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? \code{NA}, the default,
includes if any aesthetics are mapped. \code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE}
always includes. It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the
aesthetics to display. To include legend keys for all levels, even when no
data exists, use \code{TRUE}.  If \code{NA}, all levels are shown in legend, but
unobserved levels are omitted.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with
them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and
aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default plot
specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:annotation_borders]{annotation_borders()}}.}

\item{fun}{A hazard function \eqn{h(x)} (optional). When supplied,
no other function source must be provided.}

\item{pdf_fun}{A PDF function (e.g. \link{dnorm}). When supplied without
\code{cdf_fun}, the CDF is derived by numerical integration.}

\item{cdf_fun}{A CDF function (e.g. \link{pnorm}). When supplied without
\code{pdf_fun}, the PDF is derived by numerical differentiation.}

\item{survival_fun}{A survival function (e.g. \code{function(x) 1 - pnorm(x)}).
The CDF is computed as \eqn{F(x) = 1 - S(x)} and the PDF by
differentiation.}

\item{qf_fun}{A quantile function (e.g. \link{qnorm}). The CDF is derived via
interpolation and the PDF by differentiation.}

\item{xlim}{A numeric vector of length 2 giving the x-range.}

\item{n}{Number of points at which to evaluate. Defaults to 101.}

\item{args}{A named list of arguments passed to \code{fun}, or shared by
both \code{pdf_fun} and \code{cdf_fun}.}

\item{pdf_args}{A named list of additional arguments specific to \code{pdf_fun}
(overrides \code{args}). Ignored when using the direct hazard interface.}

\item{cdf_args}{A named list of additional arguments specific to \code{cdf_fun}
(overrides \code{args}). Ignored when using the direct hazard interface.}

\item{color}{Line color for the hazard curve.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 layer.
}
\description{
\code{geom_hf()} creates a ggplot2 layer that plots a hazard function. Two
interfaces are supported:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{PDF + CDF interface}: supply \code{pdf_fun} and \code{cdf_fun}; the hazard is
computed internally as \eqn{h(x) = f(x) / (1 - F(x))}.
\item \strong{PDF only}: supply just \code{pdf_fun}; the CDF is derived by numerical
integration.
\item \strong{CDF only}: supply just \code{cdf_fun}; the PDF is derived by numerical
differentiation.
\item \strong{Direct hazard interface}: supply \code{fun}, a function that returns
\eqn{h(x)} directly (e.g. a closed-form expression).
\item \strong{Survival function}: supply \code{survival_fun}; the CDF is computed as
\eqn{F = 1 - S} and the PDF by differentiation.
\item \strong{Quantile function}: supply \code{qf_fun}; the CDF is derived via
interpolation and the PDF by differentiation.
}

Supply either \code{fun} alone, one or both of \code{pdf_fun}/\code{cdf_fun},
\code{survival_fun}, or \code{qf_fun}. By default only the line is drawn (no fill).
